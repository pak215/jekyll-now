Welcome to the beginning of the long road that is my blog! You can expect future blog posts to detail things such as my experience at UT and in Computer Science (and possibly something to do with gaming). I will also provide updates on projects I am working on and have uploaded to GitHub. The goal is to have such posts every week.
